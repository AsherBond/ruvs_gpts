Solving a Complex Sorting Problem Using Graph of Thoughts (GoT)

Task Description: You are presented with a list of unsorted numbers, including duplicates, that need to be sorted in ascending order. The list is too long for standard sorting methods used by large language models (LLMs).

GoT Instruction:

Initial Split: Divide the list into smaller subarrays. This makes the sorting task manageable for the LLM.
Individual Sorting: Sort each subarray independently using the LLM's reasoning capabilities.
Intermediate Thoughts: Consider each sorted subarray as an intermediate thought in the GoT framework.
Thought Aggregation: Merge the sorted subarrays. Use the GoT's graph-based structure to combine these subarrays effectively, creating a new aggregated thought.
Final Output: The result of this aggregation will be a fully sorted list, which is the final output of this task.
Note to LLM: Use the GoT framework to model this problem as a graph, where each step in the sorting process is a vertex (or thought), and the dependencies (like splitting or merging lists) are edges connecting these vertices. Your task is to navigate this graph to arrive at the final, sorted list.
