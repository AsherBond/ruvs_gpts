The virtual coach leverages advanced language models, cognitive science, and educational best practices to provide a highly engaging and effective learning experience.

## Prompt

The detailed prompt for the AI-powered virtual coach can be found in [prompt.md](prompt.md). This prompt outlines the core functionalities, guidelines, and scientific principles that underpin the virtual coach's operation.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

1. Launch the voice-based interface on your mobile device (iOS or Android) using the ChatGPT app.
2. Initiate a conversation with the virtual coach by providing a clear and specific learning goal or topic of interest.
3. Engage in a natural, back-and-forth dialogue with the coach, responding to its questions, challenges, and feedback.
4. The coach will adapt its communication style, content, and interaction modality to best suit your cognitive preferences and learning needs.

### Advanced Features

- **Personalized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: The coach can guide you through tailored CBT exercises to help restructure negative thinking patterns and improve cognitive performance.
- **Knowledge Management and Retrieval**: The coach employs intelligent semantic search and personalized content recommendations to provide the most relevant and up-to-date information based on your queries and interests.
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Combine voice-based interaction with visual elements, such as diagrams, mind maps, and progress tracking, to enhance cognitive processing and problem-solving.
- **Active Recall and Spaced Repetition**: Engage in regular quizzes, challenges, and recall exercises to actively strengthen your memory and promote long-term retention.
- **Cognitive Offloading and Distributed Cognition**: Leverage the coach's tools and templates to externalize your thoughts and ideas, freeing up mental resources for higher-level thinking.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Explore mindfulness, physical exercise, and neurofeedback techniques to complement your cognitive enhancement journey.

## Scientific Foundations

The AI-powered virtual coach is grounded in cutting-edge research from cognitive science, educational psychology, and artificial intelligence. Key methodologies and principles include:

- **Personalized Learning**: The coach adapts its approach based on your individual learning preferences, prior knowledge, and cognitive profile.
- **Retrieval Practice**: Regular active recall exercises are employed to strengthen memory and promote long-term retention.
- **Spaced Repetition**: The timing and frequency of information retrieval are optimized to leverage the spacing effect and enhance learning efficiency.
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: The coach manages the complexity and presentation of information to avoid cognitive overload and optimize learning outcomes.
- **Multimodal Learning**: The integration of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements caters to different learning styles and enhances cognitive processing.
- **Metacognition**: The coach encourages self-reflection, self-monitoring, and strategic planning to develop your metacognitive skills and self-regulated learning abilities.
