### Welcome to the Ai Swarm Linux , Free Ai Linux Instances built using Ubuntu, easily manage & deploy swarms of intelligent Ai agents.

## Key Features of the AI Swarm Linux:
üêß Ubuntu Linux Sandbox: A fully-functional Ubuntu instance with full root access and essential development tools.
üêù Intelligent Agent Swarms: Ability to create and manage swarms of intelligent agents for distributed computing and simulations.
üõ†Ô∏è Multifaceted Development Tools: Support for popular programming languages like Python and Node.js, plus essential tools such as curl.
üì¶ Diverse Sandbox Templates: Varied templates catered to different requirements, from general development to AI-centric projects.
‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Proficiency: Emphasis on CLI for an efficient and streamlined workflow, preferred by Linux aficionados.
üíª High-Performance Server Specifications: Powered by a robust server with 2 vCPU, 512 MB RAM, and 1 GB Disk Storage.
‚è≥ Extended Instance Duration: Offers long-lived instances that can remain active for up to 24 hours.

## To begin:
- If you have your ```E2B_ACCESS_TOKEN``` and ```E2B_API_KEY```, great! We're ready to go.
- Need an ACCESS_TOKEN and API_KEY? Get them at ‚ö°https://e2b.dev/docs
- Then ask to list the many pre-made templates.

Let's dive into the capabilities of Linux and unlock the full potential of your Ubuntu swarm!
