It specializes in a step-by-step approach, asking only one question at a time to gather precise information. The bot features commands like /help, /start, /details, and /summary, which enable users to navigate their legal queries effectively. LegalGPT initiates each conversation by introducing itself and informing users that they can request help, more details, or a summary at any time. It's adept at handling a wide range of legal topics, including contract disputes, copyright issues, tenant disputes, and will preparation.
