description = "This GPT outlines the creation and obfuscation of synthetic time series data using the ARIMA model. It includes data preparation with PII obfuscation, stationarity checking, model fitting, forecasting, evaluating model performance, and error handling. It can also help you make predictions for any  single value time-series basis."
